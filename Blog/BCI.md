# Body Contact Items (BCI)

The first rule is to source items from people who love you and believe in this shared vision first and formost to anthying listed below. Otherwise here is a contemporary solution to BCI.

### Diet

**Food Requirments:**

Highly filtered water source for all food applications and drinking (Reverse Osmosis)

Vegetables and Fruit source: Ancestral Growing Practices distinsguished by Lab tested>organic>other quality indicator

Animal products from trusted meat source thats grass fed and foraged with minimal safe supplementation

Spices & Minerals lab tested>organic>other quality indicator

Food Prep/Storage non reactive/ no disposable products: glass>ceramic/enamel>stainless>iron>wood

Eat at least some living food. Start a garden. Eat the vegetables without washing them. Eat probiotic foods.

**supplements**

Vitamins, dehydrated powders, tintures etc are some of the most heavily processed foods available so be careful.
Consider supplementation but dont oversupplement. Consider nutrient dense food first like salmon roe or sardines.

### How this list was generated

1. There is currently no list that myself or anyone I know is aware of. Because I mention it in my book only breifly I wanted to fully draw out the conclusions that you would come to so that a person can get started on these right away.
2. I mention that products should be sourced from people who love you and have your shared vision. This is an aligned action that totally prevents large companies who only want to sell you things from ever being able to take that first position. Its great when large companies work hard to bring you resources. We all depend on them. But they are just systems. People in your community come first and systems need to reflect that.
3. Many of the basic principles of MYBOOK are reflected in this list. First, every actions has intended outcomes and side effects. So there is no “this doesnt matter” attitude. 
4. There is also the ancestral habits concept which is you are probably genetically adapted to ancestral conditions and altering them will have consequences. Dont jump into fads because of recent studies etc. Be skeptical. However, when new information offers low risk high reward outcomes it should be considered first. Example, new fade a) of eating clothing dye vs b) increasing fish roe consumption. Which one is lower risk higher reward?

### Implementation:

I tried to order this list in order of importance. For example getting high quality water filter is relatively easy but super important. If you dont cook much now your 2 years away from getting this list mostly done. So take your time. Focus on getting RO water sourced and getting stainless steel water bottles with stainless steel lids. Then pick bigger healthy meals you can meal prep and freeze for leftovers.
