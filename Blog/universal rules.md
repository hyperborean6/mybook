Universal System Laws

1. Law of Fragility

In complex, adapted systems, random changes are overwhelmingly more likely to reduce performance or stability than to improve it. 

2. Law of Path Dependence

Small changes or actions early in a process have disproportionately large effects over time.

3. Law of absent information - Uniform Extension (Patterns Extend Beyond Measurement)

New measurment ability will yeild new results. Mathmatical limits might only be change in dimension. If a stable pattern holds across all measurable domains, it’s rational to assume it holds in unmeasured ones, 

4. Law of all measurable outcomes

Every measurable dimension is affected by every change. 

5. Law of Diminishing Returns

As input increases, marginal gains eventually decrease.

6. Law of information Density

Informational density porportional to energy required to propogate

7. Law of Constraints

Managing constraints to keep options open, or limited, is easier than predicting requirments and designing to them.

8. Law of math

Reasoning about most effects can be pushed into universal structures that can be applied repeatedly such as A = B*C. ex. W=V*I or GDP=S*V
Think outcome = difference * amount. Distance = amount/outcome
